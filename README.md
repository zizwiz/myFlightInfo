# myFlightInfo
This App has been written to put all the info I need to check when I plan my training flights in one place. There are tabs for Weather, Metar's, Notams and one for various other utilities. The use of any data in this app is at your own risk. In flying taking-off is optional but landing is not. Always err on the side of caution. 

## Weather Tab
Under this tab there are many subtabs to pull in weather info from other sources. At present the weather is being pulled from Met office, BBC, Netweather and Windy. There are further tabs for Synoptic charts and another that pulls in a close by glider airfield which has useful information like webcams and weather radar

## Metars Tab
This brings in a preset set of airport weather. This allows me to look at weather that will be coming towards me. 

## Notams Tab
This brings in a list of NOTAMS. The interface allows me to click on a position and it will show me all the NOTAMS for that position which is very useful.

## Utilities Tab
Under this tab we have many subtabs
 
### Browser
I use this as a standard browser or choose and airfield from the drop down to see the Metar for it.
 
### Navigation 
I choose the departing airfield and destination airfield and the app will calculate many things like bearing, distance, sunrise and sunset and QNH plus lots more.
 
### Crosswind 
This will let me put in the wind direction and speed as well as letting me choose a runway to depart from. It will then work out if I can take-off on that runway or not. The max cross wind component allowed is 15knots but this can be changed in the settings.
 
### Weights and Balances
I can put in lots of data and it will work out if the aircraft is safe to take off or not. It will also help show me where a problem is if it is not safe.
 
### Compliance data
This is where I can add data for my specific training aircraft that will be used to calculate the weights and balances. I can also add more aircraft.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To run the executable you do need to be connected to the internet.

### Installing

All the items are packed into one .exe file. When you run it for the first time the exe will create all the files it requires. If you have already run the program then it will not overwrite any of the files.

## Running the tests

At this stage there are no automated tests, this is still to be worked on.


## Deployment

All the items are packed into one .exe file. When you run it for the first time the exe will create all the files it requires. If you have already run the program then it will not overwrite any of the files.
